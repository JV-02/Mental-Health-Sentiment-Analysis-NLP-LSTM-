# Mental Health Sentiment Analysis Pipeline (Data Generation + NLP + LSTM)

## Objective
Build an end-to-end pipeline to generate synthetic mental health data and perform sentiment classification using NLP and deep learning.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Synthetic data generation using rule-based and random sampling
2. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, padding)
3. Feature preparation and label encoding
4. LSTM-based sentiment classification
5. Model evaluation

## Key Learnings
- Data simulation for testing ML models
- NLP preprocessing techniques
- Sequence modeling with LSTM
- End-to-end ML pipeline development

## Files
- data_generation.ipynb
- Mental_Health_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb

## How to Run
Run data_generation notebook first, then sentiment_analysis notebook.
